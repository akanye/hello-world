    <h2>A story...</h2>
    <p style="color:green;font-family:arial">Garrett the gecko was a true believer and a dreamer.</p>
    <p style="color:#B233FF;font-family:georgia">The old tale of the shopping cart that turns into a beautiful lady dragon had always fascinated him&mdash;ever since he saw a picture of her in an old witch's book, he knew that one day he was going to find her. He was going to break the wicked witch's spell and turn her back into a lady dragon...<em>his</em> lady dragon to be exact. All he had to do was to find the magic combination of veggies to put inside the shopping cart that would break the old spell. </p>
    <p style="color:#333FFF;font-family:calibri">So for as long as he could remember, Garrett the gecko would go to the grocery store and put different combinations of veggies in his cart with the hopes that one day, right before his eyes, his cart would turn into the beautiful lady dragon of his dreams.</p>
    <p style="color:#BF110C;font-family:tahoma">One random day in October, when the rest of the world was deep in the Halloween spirit, Garrett the gecko made a stop at his usual grocery store and saw a festive display of big orange pumpkins.</p>

    <p style="color:orange;font-family:palatino;font-size:20px">"Oh my gosh, that's it...a pumpkin!" he exclaimed. At that moment, something clicked in his head. Something told him that a pumpkin was the key ingredient to break the old witch's spell.</p>
    <p style="color:#0CBF5D;font-family:Arial Rounded MT Bold">He picked out a perfect pumpkin to put inside his cart, then continued to the veggie aisle to put some other veggies in his cart&mdash;broccoli, corn, bell peppers, celery, eggplant, tomato...</p>

        <p style="color:#350CBF;font-family:impact">As he reached out to grab some ginger, all of a sudden...<strong style="font-size:60px;color:magenta">POOF!</strong></p>

    <p style="color:#BF0C76;font-family:candara">He turned his head and there she was&mdash;his beautiful lady dragon, curiously standing right there in front of him.</p>
    <p style="color:#F8BA22;font-family:book antiqua">Garrett the gecko was in shock and could not say a word. She smiled at him, and the radiance of her smile surrounded him with the most gentle, soul-nourishing warmth he had ever felt. And in that moment, he knew that his life from this day forward would never be the same.</p>
