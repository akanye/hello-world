   <h2> Charty the little Cart </h2> -By Jimmy T.
<p style="color:#3ccd4b;font-family:Brush Script MT;font-size:20px"> This is the story Charty the little cart. All of his friends and family say he really nice, but Charty thinks of himself as a pretty basic cart. He really wants to be something more than your average cart, so he told his friends and family that he was going to embark on a journey called the "Internet".
  After ten minutes of soul searching the "Internet", all became clear. "I am to become a Dragon!" Charty exclaimed! To become a dragon, one must endure the a bath of lava and the strikes of a mighty hammer, said one of the elder carts. A determined Charty said in his proudest voice: "Then that is what I must do!".

<p style="color:#B233FF;font-family:Times New Roman">And so, Charty used Waze to find the nearest Blacksmith. Now Charty didn't just use Waze to go to any old blacksmith, he first did some research by using his Yelp app to read reviews of the highest rated blacksmiths. Once Charty found the blacksmith he wanted to go to, he set off on an adventure.
  Upon arrival, Charty met the 4.5 star rated blacksmith and asked her if she can turn him into a dragon! Hammerella said that she can, but she needed for Charty to bring her the right materials. Little did Charty know, but Hammerella sent him to retrieve serveral items that were across the world!

<p style="color:#413a11;font-family:Helvetica">After meeting with Hammerella, Charty realized that getting all the items he needed was going to take him a very long time to get. Charty did not let this discourage him, he traveled as far as his little cart wheels would take him.
  Eventually, he was able to gather everything Hammerella had requested and with haste, returned to her as fast as he could. Charty presented the items to Hammerella, she instructed Charty to place all the items in to a large vat. Once the items were in, Hammerella poured lava into the vat and the items instantly melted.
  Charty looked confused, Hammerella motioned Charty to look at the vat again. The lava that had melted the items has turned blue. "Now Charty, you will have to submerge yourself into this blue lava for one hour then come back out." said Hammerella.
  Charty was reluctant, but started descending into the lava one wheel at a time. After being completely submerged for an hour, Charty felt the vat being drained, he was now out of the blue lava and to his surprise, he was still just a cart. "Is there anything missing?" asked Charty. Hammerella had almost forgotten the most important part of the process. She leaned in and whispered "this is the last part". As Charty leaned in to hear Hammerella's whisper, she headbutted him with all of her might!
  Chart exploded into a cloud of smoke, and when the smoke settled, Charty appeared as a dragon! Overjoyed with happiness, Charty took to the skies breathing fire into the air. He landed and thanked Hammerella, "I will be forever grateful to you, I will go now and see the world!".

    <h2>A story...</h2> -By Akane M
    <p style="color:green;font-family:arial">Garrett the gecko was a true believer and a dreamer.</p>
    <p style="color:#B233FF;font-family:georgia">The old tale of the shopping cart that turns into a beautiful lady dragon had always fascinated him&mdash;ever since he saw a picture of her in an old witch's book, he knew that one day he was going to find her. He was going to break the wicked witch's spell and turn her back into a lady dragon...<em>his</em> lady dragon to be exact. All he had to do was to find the magic combination of veggies to put inside the shopping cart that would break the old spell. </p>
    <p style="color:#333FFF;font-family:calibri">So for as long as he could remember, Garrett the gecko would go to the grocery store and put different combinations of veggies in his cart with the hopes that one day, right before his eyes, his cart would turn into the beautiful lady dragon of his dreams.</p>
    <p style="color:#BF110C;font-family:tahoma">One random day in October, when the rest of the world was deep in the Halloween spirit, Garrett the gecko made a stop at his usual grocery store and saw a festive display of big orange pumpkins.</p>

    <p style="color:orange;font-family:palatino;font-size:20px">"Oh my gosh, that's it...a pumpkin!" he exclaimed. At that moment, something clicked in his head. Something told him that a pumpkin was the key ingredient to break the old witch's spell.</p>
    <p style="color:#0CBF5D;font-family:Arial Rounded MT Bold">He picked out a perfect pumpkin to put inside his cart, then continued to the veggie aisle to put some other veggies in his cart&mdash;broccoli, corn, bell peppers, celery, eggplant, tomato...</p>

        <p style="color:#350CBF;font-family:impact">As he reached out to grab some ginger, all of a sudden...<strong style="font-size:60px;color:magenta">POOF!</strong></p>
        <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/91/18/d7/9118d79378f7b5dc7a9ea1c398f9b348.jpg">
    <p style="color:#BF0C76;font-family:candara">He turned his head and there she was&mdash;his beautiful lady dragon, curiously standing right there in front of him.</p>
    <p style="color:#F8BA22;font-family:book antiqua">Garrett the gecko was in shock and could not say a word. She smiled at him, and the radiance of her smile surrounded him with the most gentle, soul-nourishing warmth he had ever felt. And in that moment, he knew that his life from this day forward would never be the same.</p>
